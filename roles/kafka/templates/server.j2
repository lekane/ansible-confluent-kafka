############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id={{ broker_id }}

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on. It will get the value returned from
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() if not configured.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
#listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092

# Hostname and port the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set,
# it uses the value for "listeners" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value
# returned from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://{{ advertised_addr | default(inventory_hostname) }}:9092

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
#listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network
num.network.threads=3

# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes={{ socket_send_buffer_bytes | default(102400) }}

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes={{ socket_receive_buffer_bytes | default(102400) }}

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/var/lib/kafka

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions={{ number_of_log_partitions_per_topic | default(1) }}

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended for to ensure availability such as 3.
offsets.topic.replication.factor={{ replication_factor | default(1) }}
transaction.state.log.replication.factor={{ replication_factor | default(1) }}
transaction.state.log.min.isr={{ replication_factor_min_isr | default(1) }}

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
#log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours={{ log_retention_hours | default(168) }}

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes={{ log_segment_bytes | default(1073741824) }}

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms={{ log_retention_check_interval_ms | default(300000) }}

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect={{ zookeeper_servers }}{{ zookeeper_context }}

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms={{ zookeeper_connection_timeout_ms | default(6000) }}

##################### Confluent Metrics Reporter #######################
# Confluent Control Center and Confluent Auto Data Balancer integration
#
# Uncomment the following lines to publish monitoring data for
# Confluent Control Center and Confluent Auto Data Balancer
# If you are using a dedicated metrics cluster, also adjust the settings
# to point to your metrics kakfa cluster.
#metric.reporters=io.confluent.metrics.reporter.ConfluentMetricsReporter
#confluent.metrics.reporter.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092
#
# Uncomment the following line if the metrics cluster has a single broker
#confluent.metrics.reporter.topic.replicas=1

##################### Confluent Proactive Support ######################
# If set to true, and confluent-support-metrics package is installed
# then the feature to collect and report support metrics
# ("Metrics") is enabled.  If set to false, the feature is disabled.
#
confluent.support.metrics.enable={{ confluent_support_metrics_enable | default(false) }}


# The customer ID under which support metrics will be collected and
# reported.
#
# When the customer ID is set to "anonymous" (the default), then only a
# reduced set of metrics is being collected and reported.
#
confluent.support.customer.id=anonymous

############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0


########## Internal additional configuration changes ##########

# Enables delete topic. Delete topic through the admin tool will have no effect if this config is turned off
delete.topic.enable={{ delete_topic_enable | default(true) }}

# Enable auto creation of topic on the server
auto.create.topics.enable={{ auto_create_topics_enable | default(true) }}

# Indicates whether to enable replicas not in the ISR set to be elected as leader as a last resort,
# even though doing so may result in data loss
unclean.leader.election.enable={{ unclean_leader_election_enable | default(false) }}

# Enable controlled shutdown of the server
controlled.shutdown.enable={{ controlled_shutdown_enable | default(true) }}

# The maximum time before a new log segment is rolled out (in hours), secondary to log.roll.ms property
log.roll.hours={{ log_roll_hours | default(168) }}

# The largest record batch size allowed by Kafka. If this is increased and there are consumers older
# than 0.10.2, the consumers' fetch size must also be increased so that the they can fetch record
# batches this large.
# In the latest message format version, records are always grouped into batches for efficiency.
# In previous message format versions, uncompressed records are not grouped into batches and this limit
# only applies to a single record in that case.
# This can be set per topic with the topic level max.message.bytes config.
message.max.bytes={{ message_max_bytes | default(1000012) }}

# The number of bytes of messages to attempt to fetch for each partition. This is not an absolute maximum,
# if the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value,
# the record batch will still be returned to ensure that progress can be made. The maximum record batch
# size accepted by the broker is defined via message.max.bytes (broker config) or max.message.bytes (topic config).
replica.fetch.max.bytes={{ replica_fetch_max_bytes | default(1048576) }}

# Enable automatic broker id generation on the server. When enabled the value configured for
# reserved.broker.max.id should be reviewed.
